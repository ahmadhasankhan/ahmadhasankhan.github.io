This will go over, from start to finish, how to implement session handling using AuthLogic in Rails 4.

Run the following command in your terminal:

$ rails new app_name -d mysql -T

This will create an application called app_name, got to project root and add the authlogic gem,.
$ cd app_name
$ vim Gemfile
/* Add line "gem 'authlogic'" somewhere in the gem file */

gem 'authlogic', '~> 3.4.1'

$ bundle install


Next we’ll create our user model, controllers, and views .

$ rails generate scaffold User username:string email:string crypted_password:string password_salt:string persistence_token:string authentication_token:string

$ rake db:migrate


Crypted_password persistence_token are both expected attributes from authlogic. Now we’ll need to setup our User Model to work as the authentication class.
Now that our Model is setup, lets work on the UI. Lets add a global register link so that anybody logged out can register easily. Open your /app/views/layouts/application.html.erb file to look like this:
If you haven’t started your server yet feel free to start it now.



Open form amnd change the remove all auto generated fields and add password and password_finfirmation

open users controlles and remove all password salt and add password and password_finfirmation in strong paramenter

add this into user model

acts_as_authentic do |c|
    c.validate_login_field = false
    c.login_field = :email 
    #c.validate_password_field = true
  end


Where’s my session?


Well now that we have a way to track sessions, we do authlogic. Lets create a way to login and log out. We’ll create a user_session controller to specifically handle this, once again we’ll use ruby generate with some scaffolding.

$ rails g scaffold user_session username:string password:string


This command creates a controller that expects its respective object to have two attributes: a password, and a username. As you can probably tell from now our UserSession class does not have either of these, but our User model has a username as well as a crypted_password that is mapped to password by authlogic. It also has already been setup to expect authlogic with the act_as_authentic function.
If you open up your app/controllers/user_sessions_controller.rb you’ll see it has tons of generated code in there, we’re going to trim this down to a much nicer and more manageable file, that should look like this:
The biggest changes here are in the destroy function. UserSession does not have a id, so one does not need to be passed in. Other than that, we just did some cosmetic changes, redirecting the create and destroy functions to to :users and changing their :flash text.

Don't forget to remove migration

And replace your model with 

class UserSession < Authlogic::Session::Base
  # specify configuration here, such as:
  # logout_on_timeout true
  # ...many more options in the documentation



end

Logging In and Logging Out

Currently the login and logout functions are stored at user_session/create and user_session/destroy, not very pretty. Lets open up config/routes.rb and set up some cleaner urls. Your file should look like this:
We added :user_sessions to the resources, this is required for the login form submission. We then wrote to name match rules to change create routes for /login and /logout, this is a little more user friendly.
Now lets create the login link. We’ll want this link available everywhere, right next to our Register link preferably. Open up app/views/layouts/application.html.erb, and change the body to look like this
Since our route defines the login link as :login we can just refer to it as such, very easy and clean.
There are couple more quick UI changes, in app/views/user_sessions/new.html.erb change the h1 tag to say â€œLoginâ€. In app/views/user_sessions/_form.html.erb change the password field to f.password_field just like we did in the register form.




Feel free to login now.




 resources :user_sessions
  match 'login' => "user_sessions#new",      :as => :login, via: [:get, :post]
  match 'logout' => "user_sessions#destroy", :as => :logout, via: [:get, :post]



helper_method :current_user, :authorised_user, :authorised_admin, :isadmin,

def current_user_session
    return @current_user_session if defined?(@current_user_session)
    @current_user_session = UserSession.find
  end

  def current_user
    return @current_user if defined?(@current_user)
    @current_user = current_user_session && current_user_session.record
  end

  def authorised_user
    unless current_user
      flash[:notice]="Please Login First"
      redirect_to new_user_session_url
    end
  end

  def authorised_admin
    if (current_user && !isadmin(current_user))
      flash[:notice]="Please Login First"
      redirect_to accessdenied_users_path
    end
  end

  def isadmin(user)
    user.roles.map(&:name).include?("admin") rescue false
  end
